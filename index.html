            <p><em>Engineman 1st Class, <strong> U.S. Navy</strong></em></p>
            <p>My name is Gennadiy Mostovskiy. I am originally from Ukraine, my family and I immigrated here when I was two years old. I did most of my growing up in Kansas, but moved around a bit in my teen years. I eventually returned to Kansas to
              live with
              my father, after a short stay with him I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. I had a very successful and rewarding eight year career that took me to some of the most beautiful places in the world, <strong>for free!</strong> All in all, I
              advanced to the
              rank of 1st Class very quickly, in the span of 6 years to be exact. My final duty station before I seperated was in beautful Honolulu Hawaii, where I met my the love of my life, Megan, with whom I moved in with not long after. We
              recently
              relocated to Missouri together to be closer to family. Before relocating I had explored the idea of the tech field and it interested me. I like a good challenge, and the tech field seems like it will be perfect for that. I'm looking
              forward to
              completing some courses and hopefully getting a job in tech!</p>
